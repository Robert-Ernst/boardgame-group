    <h2>Covid Situation and how we handle it</h2>
    <h3>General Guidelines</h3>
    We are taking the virus seriously and taking stronger precautions than the legal minimum rules<br>
    People who aren't taking COVID seriously aren't welcome since they endanger everyone and the event row itself<br>

    <h3>Masks</h3>
    The face mask has to be worn at all times<br>
    The mask has to cover mouth and nose<br>
    Exceptions:<br>
    Eating: Sitting on an empty table and avoid communication<br>
    Drinking: Turning away from the table while taking the sip<br>

    <h3>ATK - Antigen Test Kit</h3>
    An ATK test not older than 24 hours has to be presented at the event<br>
    It is not required to have an test from an official doctor. A cheap supermarket one is acceptable

    <h3>Hand sanitizer</h3>
    It is advisable to bring hand sanitizer with yourself and use and share it with others since we are touching a lot of game pieces with our hands

    <h3>Vaccinations</h3>
    We strongly advise everyone to be vaccinated accordingly<br>
    We won't check the vaccination status since it's almost impossible to enter the country without vaccination anyway
