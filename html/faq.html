    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <h3>What will played next?</h3>
    We don't know<br>
    Games will be chosen spontanously and mostly based on who knows the rules already since it saves time when starting the game<br>

    <h3>Do we play game xyz?</h3>
    <a href="./games.html">A small writeup about what kind of games we play here</a><br>
    It also helps to look at the <a href="./roundsIndex.html">previously played games list</a>

    <h3>Can I bring my own games?</h3>
    Yes<br>
    Although it is not necessary since it's likely that the location has the game already<br>
    In doubt just bring the game with you, there is a good chance that we will give it a try<br>

    <h3>How much does it cost</h3>
    We don't ask for any money for ourselves<br>
    Only costs are the regular ones from the location<br>
    In case of The Stronghold Siam it's 220 THB for the first time and then 120 THB for every other time flat<br>
    Usually food and drinks are sold at the location<br>
