    <h2>Covid Situation</h2>
    Please wear a mask at all times.
    <br><br>
    It is possible to buy drinks and snacks at the location and is allowed to eat at the table but this should not be
    used as an excuse to keep the mask lowered for more than a short moment.
    <br><br>
    We take the current situation very serious and if the circumstances are getting worse we will pause this round.
    <br><br>
    We strongly advise everyone to be vaccinated accordingly.
