Roberts Bangkok Boardgame Round

We are trying to play every week.



Covid Situation
---------------
Please wear a mask at all times.
It is possible to buy drinks and snacks at the location and is allowed to eat at the table but this should not be used as an excuse to keep the mask lowered for more than a short moment.
We take the current situation very serious and if the circumstances are getting worse we will pause this round.
We strongly advise everyone to be vaccinated accordingly.


History
-------

It happened pre pandemic that a boardgame group born out of a Kinky community was formed. This group was all fun and games but died off due to covid.
Since roughly 2 years have passed due to the pandemic most previous members has left Bangkok or the contact was lost.
So Robert created a new group.
